The time in minutes to wait before aborting running builds.<br/>
Set to a negative value to wait indefinitely.<br/>
The format is '&lt;integer>' in minutes, '&lt;integer>&lt;unit>' or a combination of '&lt;integer>&lt;unit>',
where &lt;unit> is one of 'm' (minutes), 'h' (hours) or 'd' (days).
Example: '1d 4h 30m' means one day, four hours and 30 minutes which evaluates to 1710 minutes.
1710 is then the value that will be displayed later.
